After the recent show, the viewers wishing to learn more about his current whereabouts this article covers it all. From his social media to family members this article covers it all.</p><p>So, learn more as you scroll down about Hunter Moore and where he is now.</p><h3><strong>Meet Hunter Moore, The Subject Of Netflix’s The Most Hated Man On The Internet</strong></h3><p>According to <a href=#>Hunter Moore’s parents</a>, he was raised as a normal boy but the life he lead as a young adult what anything but normal. He created a “revenge p*rn” website named IsAnyoneUp.com, which probably made him the most infamous figure on the internet, keep in mind that the site was only 13 months old.</p><p>The site generated 300K viewers which were generating him an insane amount of wealth as if he could do it forever. His thriving website needed assistance which led him to hire a hacker named <a href=#>Charlie Evens</a>, the guy who hacked him before. Charlie proved profitable for Hunter as he unearthed pictures of women by hacking into their personal profiles.</p><p>An American Idol finalist, the daughter of a significant GOP donor, the co-founder of Dream Water (“Obviously didn’t make Smart Water,” Moore has said), Passion Pit bassist Kreayshawn, one Real Housewife, various Real Housewives, mothers, schoolteachers, midgets, and a woman in a wheelchair, among many others – 15 to 30 per day – suffered similar fates over the course of the website’s 16-month existence. The BBC took notice and dubbed Moore “the Net’s most despised guy.” Facebook permanently banned him, and after realizing they had been tricked, they also permanently banned Alan, his 40-pound cat (Moore responded with a photo of his penis). PayPal turned him away.</p><p>Hunter was targeted by Anonymous. One woman had her nudes posted on IAU, so she went to his house with her father. When her father wasn’t frightening enough, the woman took matters into her own hands and stabbed Moore in the shoulder with a ballpoint pen, leaving a nasty scar. “Oh my God, this is going to be the best post ever,” was his initial thinking. He was threatened with death. He developed the practice of monthly phone number changes.</p><p>Hunter is the subject of the new Netflix show The Most Hated Man On The Internet. Netflix approached him to appear on the show but naturally, Hunter turned down the offer to take part in the Netflix documentary.</p><h3><strong>What Is Hunter Moore Doing Today?</strong></h3><p>Hunter Moore is currently living a quiet secluded life away from all the attention.</p><p>Hunter has since kept a relatively low profile on the professional front. Thankfully, Hunter is banned from Facebook but is still active on his Twitter, where he describes himself as a “small town Christan boy” [sic].</p><p>He recently tweeted: “Look guys, I did my time behind bars. Living my life peacefully now, it’s been a decade about what happened. Some of you loves me, most of you hates me, if you want me to apologise well I wouldn’t. I don’t owe anyone anything.”</p><p>Hunter was sentenced to two years and six months in prison and was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. He was released in May 2017. He was released in May 2017. Moreover, he is no longer active on Twitter&nbsp;or&nbsp;Instagram, though his old posts remain.</p><p>He self-published a memoir titled Is Anyone Up?: The Story of Revenge P*rn in 2018. Judging from the Amazon reviews, Hunter doesn’t seem to be at all sorry for what he did. Hunter released one tune, Make The Internet Great Again when Substream Magazine revealed his intention to produce EDM music after serving his sentence.</p><p>Hunter’s “fans” have left nearly all five-star evaluations with remarks like “If you were there, you will miss it. If you weren’t there you will be jealous af. The history of breaking the Internet, by the badass who did it first.”. Since then, Charlotte Laws has helped 48 U.S. states establish legislation outlawing revenge p*rn.</p><p>What precisely happened to IsAnyoneUp.com, his revenge p*rn website? He did indeed sell it to businessman James McGibney, who subsequently changed the connection to point to his anti-bullying website. Now, it redirects to his personal website.</p><h3><strong>Hunter Moore Open Letter</strong></h3><p>After acquiring IsAnyoneUp?, James McGibney took aim at Hunter Moore, writing in an open letter: “Sometimes you need to be a bully to beat a bully, and I’m the first to admit that I intellectually bullied the ever-loving s**t out of you”.</p><p>The open letter read further, “Your main stated objective was to ‘ruin’ young girls’ lives. Even after they indicated that they were going to commit suicide if their unauthorized naked images weren’t removed from your website, you laughed in their faces.”</p><p>He added: “Are you still laughing now? You tried to destroy their lives, but instead, I intellectually destroyed yours. You received a masterclass in the fine art of social engineering”.</p><p>Click the link to read more from the <a href=#>open letter</a>.</p><h3><strong>Hunter Moore Family</strong></h3><p>Hunter Moore was born to his parents <a href=#>Jeanette Moore and Edward Moore</a>.
