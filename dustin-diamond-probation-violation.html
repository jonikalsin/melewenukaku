Dustin Diamond, the actor best known for his role as Screech on the early-90s’ sitcom Saved by the Bell, was arrested Wednesday in Wisconsin accused of violating his probation.
Two officials at the Ozaukee County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to TIME late Wednesday night that Diamond was in custody, but could not provide any more details.
Diamond, 39, served three months in jail earlier this year for his involvement in a bar fight that resulted in a stabbing on Christmas Day."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
