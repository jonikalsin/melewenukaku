This week, Tori shared a heartwarming moment of the five-year-old, and many fans believe he is a resilient and cheerful kid. However, it brought the realization that he now knows he’s different from other kids.</p><h3>Little People Big World: Did Jackson Roloff Know He Was Different?</h3><p>Jackson Roloff has faced several challenges. Do you recall when he was deemed too short to participate in a fairground plane ride? Nonetheless, this resilient child appears to overcome his difficulties with ease, and sometimes, fans thought <a href=#>he was oblivious to them</a>. Despite his short legs, Jackson doesn’t seem to mind and eagerly participates in soccer matches against other boys. But it was at soccer that he suddenly questioned why he was different.</p><p>It is now spring, and that means it’s time for the Little People Big World kiddo to <a href=#>participate in soccer matches</a> against other teams. These days, Jackson plays against boys who are average-sized. TLC fans know that his father, Zach, coaches soccer and sometimes he’s participated in matches in South America. However, Zach long ago understood his physical differences, while the realization is new for Jackson. Tori just hopes that he uses his differences for good.</p><h3>Little People Big World: Jackson Roloff Realises He’s Different At Soccer</h3><p>Tori Roloff shared a story about Jackson on her Instagram this week. It involved his first soccer game of the season. According to Tori, the players on the opposing team “asked Jackson why he was so small.” Probably, they felt “curious” more than anything else. Well, he went along and boldly “scored a goal.” That happened after he spoke to his mom about it. Well, she told him, “That’s how God made you, now show them how fast you are!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jackson-Roloff.jpg><p>The Little People Big World star spoke about how her son is beginning to realize that he’s not the same as other kids. Elaborating, she wrote, “He’s starting to notice that he’s different and that’s hard to cope with- however, I WANT him to know he’s different. But maybe not in the way he thinks he is.” Actually, she always wanted her kids to be seen as people before being seen as “little.” Ever since the birth of Jackson, Tori talked about not defining her child through his dwarfism.</p><h3>Prayer For Her Boy</h3><p>Little People Big World fans also saw that Tori wrote a prayer and in part, said, “I pray you to see your differences and use them to change the world. You are different, kid. Different than any kid I’ve ever met. You are one of a kind and I am so stinking proud to be your mom.”</p><p>Grandma Amy turned up in the comments. She seemed very encouraging, saying, “You’re an amazing Mama to him Tori. I know how you feel, I felt very similar things and I’m a little person mom. You’ve got thus, (sic). He’s got this. With You And Zach as his parents. You two are showing him how awesome he is.”</p><p>Do you believe that Jackson will develop into a confident adult, given the combined efforts and support of his family?
