I watch it and say, ‘Okay, that’s him doing what he does, what Kanye would do.’ Even the Trump support was a little out there for me.&nbsp;One week it’s ‘I don’t want my kids raised by a white woman,’ and the next week it’s ‘I wanna go home.’”</p><p></p><p>50 Cent went on to say that he doesn’t buy the idea that Kanye West is “crazy” and believes the Yeezy mogul is fully aware of the things coming out of his mouth.</p><p>“He’s offering a description of crazy, but when you get in certain areas, they’re not gonna actually be compassionate for what’s going on with him,” he continued. “He’s not crazy where he doesn’t know what he’s saying. He knows exactly what he’s saying.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>50 Cent and Kanye West famously battled it out for the top spot on the Billboard 200 back in September 2007 when his Curtis album faced off against Ye’s Graduation. The latter comfortably won the contest by a margin of 266,000 sales, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>shifting the trajectory of Hip Hop</a> in the process.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/10/cube-kanye.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Ice Cube Blasts Kanye West: ‘Please Leave My Name Out Of All The Antisemitic Talk’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 18, 2022</p></a><p>Meanwhile, Dame Dash, who played an integral role in signing Kanye to Roc-A-Fella in 2002, has admitted he’s <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>“worried” about Ye’s wellbeing</a> and believes the Donda rapper deserves “compassion” during what appears to be a mental health episode.</p><p>“He’s my brother,” he said during an appearance on&nbsp;Kick Game‘s sneaker shopping series this week. “I’m worried about him. N-gga, can I ask you a question? Is he bipolar or not, did he tell you that? So if you checked off the boxes of bipolar, is he acting that? So then leave it at that.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “Worry about his health if you care about him at all. I’m just saying, man, regardless to what he’s saying, it’s the way he’s saying it. I don’t care what he’s saying, I want him to live. Y’all worried about the wrong shit.</p><p>“If you know a man has a problem and you know he might be checking the boxes off for the symptoms of that problem, why do you judge him as if he doesn’t have a problem? It’s not logical.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnaX92f46toK2klWOCcXnCnqWtZZuWu7qxjLCcrKxdo7y1ecKrmLOxXZa7tbWMrJymoaSewK4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oprah-winfrey-2.html><span>←</span><span>Oprah Winfrey Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
