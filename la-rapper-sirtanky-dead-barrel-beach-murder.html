When the lifeguard brought it to shore, he opened the container to discover the body of the L.A. rapper. The lifeguard told the outlet that he opened the container because its weight was “suspicious” to him.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>When the barrel was opened, Sirtanky wasn’t in a state of decomposition; so there was some suggestion that the death had been fairly recent. However, the coroner’s office has not confirmed this detail as of this writing.</p><p>“At about 8 p.m., there’s a high tide here, and there’s a possibility that the container could have come in from the ocean and then got stuck in the lagoon — but we don’t know,” Reynaga said to the outlet.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-04-at-6.15.10-PM-250x142.jpg alt="L.A.
