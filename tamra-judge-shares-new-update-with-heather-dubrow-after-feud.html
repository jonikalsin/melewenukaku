I felt totally uncomfortable all the time looking at Jeff. Like, ‘Jeff, you never want me to go back to the show.’ He’s like, ‘You didn’t say anything.’ And I said, ‘Just participating in this conversation is not a good look’ … There was a moment where I just was sitting and I go, ‘Andy if you’re listening, I’m not behind this [laughs].’”</p><p>Although it is unclear whether or not filming has begun on the <a href=# rel=noopener>upcoming 17th season</a> of The Real Housewives of Orange County, Heather <a href=# rel=noopener>seemingly confirmed</a> she and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Shannon Beador</strong></a> were returning when she shared a photo of the two of them on her Instagram Story last month, along with the caption, “Here we goooooooo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJGiv6J5ya6boJ1dqLWivsSsZKedp2LCsbDArZxmr5mptW60xJqroZ2iYrG2rtGormaZlqmys3nFnqydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susan-lanier-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Susan Lanier Net Worth</span></a>
