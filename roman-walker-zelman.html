The pair married on September 3, 2000, after getting to know each other. At a secluded residence in Santa Barbara, California, they exchanged wedding vows. Messing’s co-star, Eric McCormack, and Sean Hayes were among the 150 relatives and friends that attended her wedding. Sean, a gay actor, is married to Scott Icenogle. Daniel gave her a 1920s diamond-and-platinum ring for their wedding. The couple moved to Manhattan and became parents to Roman after a few years. Debra and her husband, however, divorced after 11 years of marriage. “We both wanted it to endure forever,” the actress remarked in an interview, “and it’s a sad thing that it wasn’t able to go the course.”</p><p>On June 5, 2012, the Women actress filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Messing requested shared custody in her divorce petition filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The couple chose to co-parent their son and have remained friends to this day. Roman’s parents divorced in 2010, according to court documents. On March 1, 2016, their divorce was completed. Messing began dating Will Chase, her Smash co-star, in late 2011.
