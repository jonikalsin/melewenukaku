I’ve worked in this business a long time. I have kept so many friendships. I try and always be professional.”</p><p>Chrishell continued saying, “”At the end of the day, you don’t always have to be nice if somebody keeps pushing you and does not respect your boundaries and that is OK.”</p><p>Below are some photos from the Selling Sunset reunion.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>Selling Sunset</strong> </a>season 5 reunion is set to debut on Friday May 5th and will be moderated by <strong>Queer Eye</strong> fashion guru, <strong>Tan France</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5intrTAyKecZqubnr20edKeo6Whnpx6tMHNrJytZaKawq%2B1zqdkmqtdmLWztdKhnKWkXai9pq3KrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nunzia-de-girolamo-bio-height-net-worth-husband-2.html><span>←</span><span>Nunzia De Girolamo- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Husband</span></a>
