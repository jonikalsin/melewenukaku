A sad rodeo accident that killed a 20-year-old results in a GoFundMe</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Breanna Chadwick, a Georgian woman in her 20s who was badly injured in a devastating rodeo accident, passed away last week.</strong></p><p>The now-deceased girl was present on July 8 at a Murray County Saddle Club event, according to the Dalton Daily Citizen. However, a horse rushed into a gate during the incident, which took place outside of Atlanta, and struck and hurt her.</p><p>Later, Breanna was flown to a hospital in Chattanooga where she eventually passed away from her wounds. Breanna’s sister, Kirstin Chadwick, stated on social media:</p><p>“God, I beg you to intercede for my sister Breanna Chadwick. She was involved in an awful accident. We desperately need your prayers for her. The doctors warned to be ready for the worst when they airlifted her to Erlanger Hospital! PRAY, PLEASE, PLEASE.”</p><p>According to her obituary, Chadwick attended Reinhardt University and wanted to become a third-grade teacher.</p><p>“She was sassy and always had a lovely smile. She was frequently spotted getting a lemonade from Chick-fil-A or a single scoop of birthday cake ice cream from Bruster’s. She cherished her jeep, Lily, Peanut, the color teal, and her family and friends above all else.”</p><p>Her interests were further detailed in the obituary, which revealed that she had grown up playing basketball, softball, and lacrosse:</p><p>“All children loved her, and she loved them all. She has and will continue to have a huge impact on many people’s lives.” Breanna Chadwick’s family has been given financial support through a GoFundMe page.</p><h2>Hali Cheyene has created a GoFundMe campaign to seek money to assist the Chadwick family with burial and medical costs. The page has received more than $23,000 thus far</h2><p>The Murray County Saddle Club wrote on Facebook that following the tragic event, it planned a candlelight memorial for Breanna Chadwick:</p><p>“After much crying and careful thought, we have spoken with a Chadwick family member. The procession and shows will continue at [their] request. We’ll hold a candlelight vigil in Breanna Chadwick’s memory. Additionally, we will provide ribbons for everyone who desires to wear one throughout the parade and the remaining performances this week.”</p><p>The public has been shocked by a rodeo accident before. An Amish couple was killed in Virginia in October 2021 while operating a horse-drawn buggy after being hit from behind by a truck. Although they all eight of their kids lived, the accident left them with serious injuries.</p><p>A teen bull rider who had been thrown off by the animal in March 2022 collapsed. Before the bull trampled on the youngster, the boy’s father hurried to the arena to save him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiZq52Ro7uiecKhmJ2vmZi4bsPHqGSwmaNiwKmxjJpkrJmUYr%2BwsMSoZJqbk56xprrTZquhmaRiuKq4y56bZpldZ31uxcSaqWannJl6s7HSrqOtq12eu26tjKCmn62embqmec%2Banp5lopa2tLXNoGSmp6KaerW0wKdka2hgZX1w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-v.html><span>←</span><span>The King Of England Who Nearly Took Over France</span></a>
