The account takes pics of <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, 19, pre-lip injections, and places the head on photos of her now! The photoshops aren’t done particularly well, but that’s not the point;&nbsp;they’re hilarious!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>It does seem a little mean,&nbsp;but you can’t help but laugh at the ridiculous Instagrams. Kylie has fully fessed up in the past to having work done after everyone noticed that she looked dramatically different than she did as a younger teen. She confessed that she got lip injections because she was self conscious about having thinner lips. Now that Kylie’s matured and takes shares sexy pics online each and every day, it’s jarring to see her “old” face on her “new” body.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform hPQM8QRU-RiPpdJ98]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of the latest pics from the Instagram&nbsp;photoshopped Kylie’s “old” face onto her sexy pic from Halloween, when she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dressed like <strong>Christina Aguilera</strong> from the “Dirrty” music video</a>. That one is especially&nbsp;jarring,&nbsp;since we just saw the photo on October 29&nbsp;with Kylie and her normal face. So funny! Maybe funnier? The account is so quick to tease Kylie that they posted the photoshop literally the same day!</p><h3>Kylie Jenner’s Sexy Lip Kit Photoshoot — See The Hottest Pics</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>We&nbsp;doubt that Kylie is offended by this, since she’s been so open about her lip injections. She probably doesn’t even have time to pay attention to the account! Kylie’s been busy having a blast during Halloween, and starring in her latest PUMA campaign video.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think the Kylie photoshops are funny?
