Sealant is one of them. Here is how you can find it in the game.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a> has a vast number of items, some useful, some useless, for the players to find and collect. It has a research system that unlocks more items as you progress through it. You can also add mods and customize different items on your workstations. The sealant will be required to do the work. It is even required for one of the early quests in the game.</p><p>Sealant is a pretty common material for the players to find. From the description, it is called an organic substance. So, any organic life will have a chance of dropping sealant in the game. But knowing what to do in order to get it can save you randomly searching for it. Here, we will show you how to find sealant in Starfield.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Finding Sealant in Starfield</h2><p>We have already said you can find it in any living organism. But you can pinpoint which living organism will give you sealant by scanning them. After scanning an organism fully, it will tell you what drops you can get by killing them. So make sure to scan and remember that. This way, you won’t have to run around scanning everything, and you will have a constant source of sealant you can get from by killing that one organism on the same planet.</p><p>Another way to get sealants fast is by buying them from the vendor. Different vendors have sealants for sale. You can buy them as long as you are willing to part ways with some credits. Here are all the shops that sell sealant in the game:</p><ul><li><strong>UC Distribution</strong>&nbsp;– Commercial District (New Atlantis, Jemison)</li><li><strong>Outlands</strong>– Commercial District (New Atlantis, Jemison)</li><li><strong>Newill’s Goods</strong>&nbsp;– (Neon, Volii Alpha)</li><li><strong>Sieghart’s Outfitters</strong>&nbsp;– (Neon, Volii Alpha)</li><li><strong>Apex Electronics</strong>&nbsp;– The Well (New Atlantis, Jemison)</li><li>Any Trade Authority vendor</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2BowaK%2BxaKcpZxdrLWmvsRmq6hllp67pXnSnpilmZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-easiest-sport-to-get-an-athletic-scholarship-in.html><span>←</span><span>What is the easiest sport to get an athletic scholarship in?</span></a>
