Even She Is Surprised</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Margot Robbie, a star of The Suicide Squad, finds the internet’s infatuation with her feet to be “flattering.”</p><p>When Robbie appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! with Anthony Anderson as a guest presenter, she was talking about a feat she pulled off on set that entailed picking a lock with her toes. She said that she could “open a lock no issue” and is “extremely deft” with her toes. She stated: “I recall that we were going to need to use someone else because we needed to cut in tight because I had to go to another set, but our editor, who also worked on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said, “Those aren’t Margot Robbie’s feet.” Margot Robbie’s feet have been seen by me.”</p><p>In response to Robbie’s remarks, writer/director James Gunn, who appeared on the programme alongside John Cena, said that he is well aware of the public’s fascination with the Harley Quinn actor’s toes. I’m on Twitter, so I can assure you that people want to see your feet, Gunn stated. “I have no idea where these individuals are from. Is it possible to view Margot’s feet? That’s what you’re thinking about, I ask? Even if there are massive bombs, collapsing buildings, Idris Elba, John Cena, Margot Robbie, and other fantastic actors, [her feet] are the stars.”</p><p>Robbie doesn’t mind if people on the internet are curious to see her feet, which were prominently featured in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. During the interview, Robbie added, “It’s weird, but I’m flattered by it. Gunn said, referring to her as a “human swiss army knife,” saying the stunt in question was not only the “hardest thing” he had asked her to perform on set, but also one “[he] never imagined she would be able to achieve.”</p><p>Margot has to get her toes along a dead body, pick a key off of the body, flip her toes backwards to place the key into the lock above her head, unlock it, and then come down straight, according to Gunn. Margot is being hanged up by handcuffs over her head in this sequence. “I’m watching this; in all honesty, torturing Margot was my favourite set activity today.”</p><p>The Suicide Squad, which debuts on HBO Max and in theatres on August 6, will feature all of Robbie’s stunts as Harley Quinn.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
