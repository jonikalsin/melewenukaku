Nothing is official yet or when these skins will drop in the game<i>,</i>&nbsp;but they should appear in the shop very soon.</p><p>Fortnite has been killing it recently with their return to the OG seasons. Millions of players have returned to the free-to-play battle royale for nostalgia purposes, and some have stuck around. With the addition of Zero-Build, players can enjoy the OG seasons once more without having to build. Epic Games dropped OG Season 7 which brought back Frosty Flights and weapons such as the drum gun and the combat shotgun.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s Included in Fortnite x Invincible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/invincible-3-1024x576.jpg><p>Invincible is the newest property Fortnite is collabing with. The skin line is called “Guardians of the Globe,” a reference to the team of heroes who protect Earth from inner or extraterrestrial threats in the show. The set features three popular characters: Invincible, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>FORTNITE X INVINCIBLE <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/YyPnHK582L</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">November 16, 2023</a><p>The Back Bling has their capes or iconic items from the show. The pickaxes are also iconic to the show such as War Woman’s Mace and Reanimen’s Arm.&nbsp;</p><a href=#>Fortnite’s New Voice Reporting Feature Rolls Out</a><p>An emote is part of the&nbsp;set called “Fastest Fastball” where your character will throw a baseball and watch in the distance before it appears back in your hand. Lastly, one of the coolest additions this collab brings is a Loading Screen featuring the cast from the show.</p><p>Drawn by Ryan Ottley who drew the interior art for the Invincible comics for most of its 144-issue run. Bringing Ottley in to draw a piece for the collab is dope because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>fans</strong></a> still love to see his talents in the Invincible franchise.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>FORTNITE X INVINCIBLE LOADING SCREEN <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/Sm4hqtH8Er</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">November 16, 2023</a> <a href=#>Invincible’s Omni-Man Makes Mortal Kombat 1 Appearance in Full Character Trailer</a><p>Omni-Man is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 which makes Fortnite another video game collaboration for the franchise. Maybe one day fans will get a big budget standalone video game on consoles and PC.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Invincible Too Violent for Fortnite?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fwmedia.fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/16110814/invincible-amazon-prime-season-1-1024x576.png><p>Fortnite has collaborated with dozens of brands at this point. From Marvel/DC superheroes to various anime properties, it feels like the game has done it all. More mature and violent properties such as Rick and Morty, The Walking Dead, and Resident Evil have character skins. With Season 2 of the show currently premiering, this is a great way for Amazon to promote the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The skins will likely not have the same bloody and violent nature as the show, but Fortnite fans may turn into Invincible fans after these skins drop. Or vice versa where diehard fans of the show might play the game to play as one of their favorite characters in a video game.&nbsp;</p><p>This collaboration also leaves the door open for The Boys, another violent and popular Amazon Prime Video TV Series. Whatever happens in the future for this collaboration, keep an eye on the shop as these skins should be dropping very soon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Follow us for more entertainment coverage on </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>YouTube.</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOxsLnWoqmeZpOkunC1za%2Bgp5uZl7mmecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BMmqmeZZOkuqq6xmarqGWWpL%2B1usitnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assign-stars-to-a-lyft-driver-for-example-html.html><span>←</span><span>Assign stars to a Lyft driver for example</span></a>
