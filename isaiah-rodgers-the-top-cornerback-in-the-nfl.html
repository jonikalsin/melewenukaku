After playing primarily from the bench in his first two years in the NFL, he has now become a regular starter for the Indianapolis Colts.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span>And now that he's getting the chance to showcase himself more as a starter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Rodgers</a> is letting the mainstream in on a little secret: that he is in fact the top cornerback in the entire NFL.</span></p><p class=p1><span>That's quite a claim for a corner who just became a regular starter in his third season. And many would argue that he's not even the second-best corner on his own team, with Stephon Gilmore - who signed with Indianapolis this season - and Pro Bowler Kenny Moore with much more established track records.</span></p><p class=p1><span>But those who have watched the Colts closely since last season know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Rodgers</a> has sneakily been one of the top corners in the league.</span></p><p class=p1><span>After getting more playing time due to mounting injuries last season, Rodgers quickly established himself as a stellar coverage corner. While he's relatively small, he makes up for it with his tremendous speed, athleticism, and ball skills.</span></p><p class=p1><span>And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Rodgers</a> has continued to build upon that promising sophomore season in his third year. After starting behind free-agent signing Brandon Facyson in the depth chart, Isaiah Rodgers quickly won over the starting spot with his strong play.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span>Opposing offenses seem to be catching wise and are not even daring to take him on. He has been targeted just 25 times this season compared to 82 for Gilmore. He has been given an overall grade of 82.1 by Pro Football Focus, which would put him right up there with Jalen Ramsey (82.5) if he had been targeted more.</span></p><p class=p1><span>While some may quibble with branding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Rodgers</a> as the top corner in the NFL, it’s not up for debate that he is among the most promising players at the position and is well on his way toward that top spot.</span></p><p class=p1><span>So if you’re all ready to ride the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah Rodgers</a> hype train, you’re more than welcome to hop aboard!
