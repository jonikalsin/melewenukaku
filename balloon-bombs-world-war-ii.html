Taking advantage of the easterly winds, the Japanese created “fire-balloon bombs” that would drift across the Pacific, carried by hydrogen power, and explode over the western United States.</p><p>On May 5, 1945, three and a half years after Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor, and three months before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, one of these Japanese balloon bombs <a href=#>actually did explode</a> in rural Oregon, killing six people.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-131238 alt="Fire Balloon" width=588 height=1224 data-sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fire-balloon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-131238 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Japanese balloon bomb re-inflated at Moffett Field, California after it had been shot down by a Navy aircraft.

She was pregnant at the time, so her husband pulled over to give her a moment.</p><p>As Mitchell chatted with a nearby construction crew about local fishing conditions, Elyse and her class momentarily wandered off. When they were about 100 yards from the car, he heard her shout.</p><p>“Look what I found, dear,” he remembered her saying.</p><p>It was one of the construction workers that recalled what happened next.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-131239 alt="Japanese Balloon Bomb" width=800 height=927 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/japanese-balloon-bomb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-131239 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The bombs attached to the bottom of a Japanese fire balloon.

The fifth child, Joan Patzke, survived the initial blast but died several minutes later from her injuries.</p><p>Thus these schoolchildren and their teacher became the only known victims of Japan’s fire balloon campaign.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-131241 alt="Balloon Bomb Scale" width=900 height=692 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/balloon-bomb-scale.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-131241 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Recovered Japanese balloon, with a rendering of a human added for scale.

Each one contained a barometer-operated valve that would release hydrogen if the balloon gained too much altitude, as well as sandbags that would be dropped if the balloon dipped too low.</p><p>Despite the Japanese releasing an estimated 9,000 of these fire balloons, only 342 reached U.S. soil. Most of them landed along the West Coast, however, some of them drifted as far inland as Nebraska.</p><p>Most of them were shot down, and the rest fell on their own.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-131189 alt="French Balloon" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/french-balloon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-131189 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Underwood Archives/Getty Images </span><span class=caption-body>Balloon bomb of French design, similar to the ones designed by the Japanese. 1914.</span></p><p>It is unknown if the Japanese planned to release more of them, given that, several months after the explosion in Oregon, the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and World War II came to an end.</p><p>Aside from the single explosion in Oregon, none of the balloons caused any real damage when they landed. One hit a power line and caused the temporary blackout of the nuclear-weapons plant in Hanford, Washington, but no injuries were sustained, leaving the Oregon victims as the only six people killed in the continental U.S. during World War II.</p><p>Next, check out these stunning, rarely-seen photos of <a href=#>World War II in color</a>.
