Associated Press and Phil Sandlin</p><p>Few&nbsp;athletes in the history of figure skating have experienced a ride quite like Tonya Harding, the name that became synonymous with not only triumph but also controversy. Here we go with the story of the figure skater: from her humble roots to the mark that she left on the world of sport.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Early Life and Career</h2><p>Tonya Maxine Harding&nbsp;was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, and before she even turned 3, she was taken to the ice to skate. Even though she dropped out of high school during her sophomore year to dedicate her life to being a skater, she later earned her GED and did make some history on the street luge circuit. Most famously in 1991, she became the first American woman to land a triple axel in competition.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Triumphs and Notoriety</h2><p>Harding's career peaked in 1991 when she landed her first national championship, confirming her place as a figure skating sensation. But in 1994, her name became synonymous with scandal after her ex-husband arranged the assault on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan, which resulted in Harding pleading guilty to conspiring to hinder the prosecution of the attackers. The action led to a lifetime ban from U.S. competition and a massive hit to his image.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Beyond Skating</h2><p>Harding can be seen on shows like Rosanne, Larry King Live, The Weakest Link, and Dancing with the Stars, despite the interference with her skating career. It was then, in late 2017, that her notoriety earned her a big screen debut in the feature film I, Tonya.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Media</h2><p>The media has sensationalized Harding's story. The reality of Harding's life has been muddled by reports chronicling tales of inflated drama, misinformation, and a shortage of depth in the storytelling surrounding the journey of Harding.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>A Different Perspective</h2><p>While the media surrounding the story is well known, it's worth taking a look at how Harding managed to shake her struggle off and what effect she had on the sport of figure skating. Her achievements on the ice reflect her indisputable talent and passion for the sport and also the first American woman to land a triple axel.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>A Lesson in Resilience</h2><p>The story of Tonya Harding illustrates much about human nature and the world of competitive sports. Controversies aside, her odyssey stands as a testament to the unyielding resolve and dogged fearlessness one needs to triumph against all odds in the pursuit of meaning and life's purpose.<br data-mce-fragment=1>This is the way this chapter of Tonya Harding's life closes, but her story - the tale of a champion, a lightning rod for controversy, a scrapper with no quit in her - carries on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqbyvxcBmn5qqlJ67qHnAZp6loZ2lwKZ5yKerqGWknbJuv9OoqbJln5t6onnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2FyJqjZp6ZnMKzsYysopqslac%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./piper-curda.html><span>←</span><span>Piper Curda</span></a>
