As unique as his personality and craft as a comedian and an actor are, his facial structures, however, confuse many.</p><h2>Who Is Andy Samberg's Look Alike?&nbsp;</h2><p>To not confuse anyone, this personality has worked in the comedy music group, The Lonely Island and was a member in SNL (Saturday Night Live) for a good seven years, but most predominantly he is known for his role in NBC sitcom&nbsp;'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' and Jake Peralta in the Fox.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=607 style="width:580px;float:none!important;max-width:580px;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:580px;line-height:0"></span></p><p>Samberg is also a producer for 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine,' aside from playing a major role. So now that clears much on who he is let's discuss who people confuse him to.</p><p>&nbsp;He is known to be associated with Jesse Eisenberg, his replica.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=608 style="padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;line-height:0;float:none!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;display:block!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>While the striking resemblance in these two personalities can be seen quite literally, they however are not the same people.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His look alike, <a href=# rel=follow>Jesse Eisenberg</a>, is also an actor, producer, and writer (coincidence much?), and he also has his fair share of roles in comedy-drama such as 'Roger Dodger' and 'The Squid and the Whale'.</p><p>This is getting very bizarre! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=609 style="float:none!important;text-align:center!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;margin-right:auto!important;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span></p><p>And the most interesting of it all, the role that Jesse Eisenberg played as Mark Zukerberg in 'The Social Network,' which also earned him nominations for the Oscars, BAFTA, and Golden Globe was a role that Samberg wanted to play, but the Academy Award-winning film&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">was already given to Jesse.</a></p><p>Well, had he auditioned for the role alongside Eisenberg, the producers surely would have a hard time selecting one for the role.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=611 style="padding:0;float:none!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;max-width:580px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Well, as much replicas as they are, they surely could do different shifts in between, right?</p><p>Jokes apart, the Prime Time Emmy Awardee, Samberg, has multiple times played Mark Zuckerberg in Saturday Night Live,, and there was a particular episode where the three shared the same screen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and Andy Samberg Sharing Same Screen On SNL&nbsp;</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=612 style="line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-width:336px;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px"></span></p><p>Reminds us of that one spiderman meme (You know what we are talking about, right?)</p><p>And yes, we added Mark Zuckerberg in on of his look alike as well, well not exactly, but hey, the fact that Samberg can play Zukerberg does say quite a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This Might Interest You:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Who Is Priscilla Chan?

In 2020, a meme went viral of a video comparing Andy's and Jesse's facial structure, and the resemblance is purely evident.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>everyone saying jesse eisenberg and andy samberg look the same and I AGREE <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/IS2vhX7JQD</a> — luke (@traiinspottiing) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">April 18, 2020</a></p><p>Moreover, there is a whole Facebook <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">page dedicated</a> to Michael, Andy, and Jesse with the name,&nbsp;"Michael Cera + Andy Samberg = Jesse Eisenberg." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The page was made around 2010, and well, this person surely was way ahead of their time.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many people who agree that the three should play on a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">time travel movie</a> playing the same characters with different age roles.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The last of our bunch, a meme sectioning the three in different levels like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a game character</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-638 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All jokes aside, each of the three is brilliant on their own and exceptionally talented.
