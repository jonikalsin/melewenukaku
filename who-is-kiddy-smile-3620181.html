I’m a cis man but if you’re gender-fluid or nonbinary, there is no space for you to exist within this protocol.” Far from a black tux and bow tie, Kiddy sewed his own sequined jumpsuit the night before the screening of <strong>Mati Diop’s</strong> Atlantics on May 16. But he didn’t run into trouble until the next day — even though he had attended the film festival to perform at an after-party.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. Kiddy almost wasn’t allowed into the premiere of Dolor y Gloria because of his voluminous floral gown.</strong> Plans to attend the screening with filmmaker <strong>Gaspar Noé </strong>fell through, so the gatekeeper stopped the DJ and asked if he was wearing a “traditional African outfit,” Kiddy told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogueworld</a>. “It’s just hilarious to me that if you’re a black person, and you wear something that looks like a gown, people are going to ask you if it’s a traditional outfit,” he mused. Fortunately, Kiddy was finally allowed in: “Then a woman arrived and started discussing with him—from what I understood, she was his boss—and she was telling him that she was taking responsibility for my outfit and that she wanted me to go through to the carpet.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. Kiddy is prominent in Paris’ ballroom scene.</strong> The DJ grew up in Groussay, a suburb outside of Paris, but made a name for himself in this dance movement that gay and transgender dancers pioneered (Kiddy identifies as gay), according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. You can watch <strong>Jennie Livingston’s</strong> documentary&nbsp;Paris is Burning&nbsp;for extra background on the ballroom scene!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kiddy-smile-5-things-to-know-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3.&nbsp;The DJ performed for the president of the French Republic.</strong> President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> personally invited Kiddy to perform at Élysée, the presidential palace in Paris, in honor of France’s electronic musicians. Kiddy made headlines by showing up to the gig in a T-shirt that read, “Son of immigrants, black and gay.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>4. Kiddy’s hit song “Let A B!tch Know” has racked up over a million views.</strong> He is also known for the tracks “Dickmatized,” “Be Honest” and “Let Myself Alone.” Kiddy released his debut album,&nbsp;One Trick Pony,&nbsp;on Aug. 31, 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kiddy-smile-5-things-to-know-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>5. Kiddy starred in Gaspar Noé’s film&nbsp;Climax.</strong> Yes, the same filmmaker whom Kiddy was supposed to attend the Cannes Film Festival screening with!&nbsp;Climax&nbsp;is a drama/mystery about a dance troupe that practices in an empty school one night, fueled by sangria, which turns out to be laced with LSD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4qrDDsmSspZmhsm5%2FlWtnanBhZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-rick-hallucinate-the-phone-call.html><span>←</span><span>Did Rick hallucinate the phone call?
