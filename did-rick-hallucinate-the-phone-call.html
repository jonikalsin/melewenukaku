Last Sunday’s episode of The Walking Dead featured one of the show’s most heartbreaking scenes ever as Daryl Dixon found the brother he had finally been reunited with — Merle — hunched over and eating human flesh as a zombie.</p><p>however Who does Rick see in the white dress?</p><p>The episode begins just as last week’s episode ended, with Rick seeing a vision of Lori in an all white dress. This time, though, Lori is first seen in the prison yard, and then outside the prison fences. Yup, Rick has officially lost it.</p><p>What did Lori ask Rick to do on the phone?</p><p>(Lesson learned: when you love someone, tell him or her, because he or she might die and turn into a zombie at any time.) Lori tells Rick she loves him, and to take care of their children. The phone call breaks up and Rick loses the connection to Walking Dead’s afterlife hotline. He weeps.</p><p>Still, Is Judith A Ricks kid?</p><p>Though Rick raised Judith (Cailey Fleming) on “TWD,” she’s biologically his best friend’s daughter. Fleming told Insider if Judith learned Shane was her biological dad, it wouldn’t change anything. She said Rick’s “her daddy,” in every sense of the word.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Were_Merle_and_Daryl_abused></span><strong>Were Merle and Daryl abused?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Rooker explained, “At the time when I saw the scarring on Daryl’s back in the woods…the scarring is the same scarring on my back, because I was abused before my little brother was abused.” Rooker continued, “So in Merle’s mind, when Merle splits, he’s thinking…you know in my mind, I felt Merle left because the</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_we_ever_see_Merle_again></span><strong>Do we ever see Merle again?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Merle reappears in an injured Daryl’s hallucinations, in which he taunts Daryl for giving up, telling him to be tougher. He also tells Daryl to stand up to Rick, even suggesting that Daryl shoot him, and mentioning that Rick handcuffed him and left him to die on the roof of the department store.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_the_baby_Ricks_or_Shanes></span><strong>Is the baby Ricks or Shanes?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robert Kirkman revealed in an AMA that Judith is indeed Shane’s daughter. Judith was the only baby in the Comic Series who was born after the outbreak, until the birth of Hershel some time after All Out War: Part Two.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Lori_become_a_zombie></span><strong>Did Lori become a zombie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Walking Dead season 3 saw Lori Grimes was sadly eaten by a walker, but a deleted scene also turned her into a zombie. Played by Sarah Wayne Callies, Lori was an original member of The Walking Dead cast, appearing in every episode of its first two seasons.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Rick_see_Lori_after_death></span><strong>Why did Rick see Lori after death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After his wife Lori is killed in a walker attack, Rick begins to lose his sanity and begins to see her everywhere, and has conversations with her, Amy Jim, and Jacqui through an unplugged phone. He eventually overcomes his grief and stops seeing her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Rick_mean_when_he_says_he_couldnt_put_it_back_together></span><strong>What does Rick mean when he says he couldnt put it back together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He couldn’t put himself back together before she died. He even says he was focused on keeping her and the baby alive as would worry about trying to work through their marital problems after Judith was born. He didn’t get the chance to “put it back together” because she died. 16.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Merle_let_Michonne_go></span><strong>Why did Merle let Michonne go?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He let Michonne go back because he knew she could help his brother, not because he was a big angel. He also let her go because he knew that trading her to the Governor probably wasn’t going to have a good outcome.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Carol_and_Daryl_get_together></span><strong>Do Carol and Daryl get together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many fans have paired of Daryl and Carol for years as a potential couple, and the two are even getting a spin-off together after The Walking Dead ends. But the show has never let that happen, and kept a brother-sister type relationship between them, for the most part.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Judith_call_Michonne_mom></span><strong>Does Judith call Michonne mom?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seeing Michonne and Judith together, and hearing Judith call Michonne “Mom,” is a reminder of how much these two have been through since Rick disappeared.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Carl_name_his_sister_Judith></span><strong>Why did Carl name his sister Judith?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“When the Dead Come Knocking”</p><p>Carl talks to Rick about the baby’s name, and Carl tells Rick about how Daryl calls her “Lil’ Ass Kicker”, which Rick finds amusing. They finally decide on “Judith” after Carl’s third grade teacher, Judith Mueller.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_was_Judith_when_Carl_died></span><strong>How old was Judith when Carl died?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carl Grimes Was About 16</p><p>Doing some math based on that knowledge, and considering that Carl’s half-sister Judith was about three years old when he died, and she was born when he was 12 or 13, Carl would have been about 15, possibly 16 when he died.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Daryl_love_Beth_TWD></span><strong>Did Daryl love Beth TWD?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arguably the one with the most romantic potential for Daryl was Beth. Left to escape on their own, they shared intimate conversations about their lives, drank together, and seemed like a sweet couple out on the first date.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Daryl_asexual_TWD></span><strong>Is Daryl asexual TWD?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There were many fans who thought the same; actor Norman Reedus has in-fact even received fan-mail thanking him for portraying an asexual character. However, Robert Kirkman, the writer of the show and comics, revealed that Dixon is “straight” and “somewhat asexual”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Daryls_dad_do_to_him></span><strong>What did Daryls dad do to him?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Daryl was raped by his dad; him and Merle killed him together, eventually, because of it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_a_hacksaw_cut_through_handcuffs></span><strong>Can a hacksaw cut through handcuffs?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hacksaws. Hacksaws are small hand-held saws that can be used to cut the chain between the two wrist cuffs, but should not be used close to the skin to cut off the wrist cuffs themselves.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Merle_escape_the_roof></span><strong>How did Merle escape the roof?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Of course, Walking Dead fans know that Merle escaped from being handcuffed by cutting off his hand with a hacksaw (as the blade was too dull to cut through the handcuffs).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Rick_know_Judith_isn%E2%80%99t_his></span><strong>Does Rick know Judith isn’t his?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rick later revealed that he knows that Judith is not his biological daughter, but he loves her regardless and is willing to protect her at all costs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Sophia_end_up_in_the_barn></span><strong>How did Sophia end up in the barn?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He found where she lost her doll (maybe she was bitten by the river). But he doesn’t find her. Because she was found stuck in the marsh by Jimmy and thrown in the barn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Lori_eaten_by_Walker></span><strong>Was Lori eaten by Walker?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>That said, Greg Nicotero, the special make-up effects supervisor as well as an executive producer and director on, confirmed that the walker did indeed eat Lori after her death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_we_ever_see_Jim_as_a_walker></span><strong>Do we ever see Jim as a walker?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After attempting to get Jim to the CDC, Jim has enough of the strenuous journey and asks to be left behind. The group grants his request and leave him behind. Jim then dies from the infection, reanimates, and turns into a walker.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ksaqwjKugnKNdna6tuNScoKeZpJp6tbTEZqehp56aeqSty6Vm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-klein.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Klein</span></a>
