He had an early connection with The Beatles, even attempting to get them booked for an audience participation event. However, the organizers at the time didn't quite grasp the potential of rock 'n' roll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c59ac2c6c7c3847ed4ac9a9a9a13d5ce8068863c960dff48970c3383e2b1f810.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Michael McCartney in London, England in December 1967 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>But, as fate would have it, this initial brush with fame would eventually lead to Mike's journey into the world of entertainment. The turning point came when Paul gifted Mike a Nikon camera in 1967, which spontaneously inspired a little ditty, "Thank U Very Much," later developed into a single for the satirical group Scaffold, which Mike was part of, along with Roger McGough and John Gorman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/57a08cb39ece4439f7cbe4f2ed14b2ab9c773fa262292a15a3933440f03d3c84.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Members of the musical trio, The Scaffold, Roger McGough, John Gorman, and Michael McCartney in London, England in 1966 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The Scaffold's live performances were always infused with humor and had a knack for creating a jovial atmosphere. One of the highlights of Mike's career was the release of "Lily The Pink," a delightfully absurd party song that he and The Scaffold took to number one on the charts for an impressive four weeks in 1968.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/15b6ab0f14e729261aafbb1e32e8fc5d916d45672d6f7dd8d98aae62fe55bc04.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Comedy musicians Roger McGough, John Gorman, and Michael McCartney in London, England in 1966 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>This silly track, with its catchy tunes and humorous lyrics, endeared itself to audiences, becoming an enduring musical gem.
