They’re like eight foot, nine feet, 10 foot. They look like aliens to us. Big eyes. They have big eyes. Like, I can’t explain it, and big mouth. They’re shiny eyes and they’re human. They’re 100 percent not human,” Kenmore stated.</p><p>Eerily, police body camera footage from the night captured a green light streaking across the night sky around 11:50 p.m. At least 21 people from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah also reported seeing the phenomenon.</p><p>When police received the call from Kenmore, one of the responding officers told his partner that he, too, saw something fall out of the sky that night.</p><p>“I’m so nervous right now,” one officer stated, according to 8 News Now. “I have butterflies, bro — saw a shooting star and now these people say there’s aliens in their backyard.”</p><p>Officers arrived at the scene and searched the backyard after speaking to the family, but they came up empty-handed. As the footage circulated on social media, many people claimed the entire ordeal was a hoax — but Scott Roder came to a very different conclusion.</p><h2>Scott Roder And UFO Experts Tackle The Case</h2><p>Just this month, renowned crime scene analyst Scott Roder weighed in on the Las Vegas alien footage. Roder, an expert in crime scene reconstruction, has testified in highly publicized criminal cases around the world, such as the murder trial of <a href=# rel=noopener>Oscar Pistorius</a>.</p><p>Roder collaborated with Jim Quirk, a reporter from the Extraterrestrial Reality podcast, to go over the family’s video in painstaking detail.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-491660 alt="Las Vegas Alien Police Footage" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/las-vegas-alien-police-footage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-491660 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Las Vegas Metro Police</span><span class=caption-body>Police bodycam footage of Kenmore’s family the night of the incident.</span></p><p>Searching frame by frame, Roder broke down the footage and came to a haunting conclusion: The video is not a hoax.</p><p>“I applied the same principles that I would apply to any kind of homicide investigation,” Roder stated, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox News</a>. “At this particular time, with what we’ve seen here, is proof of a couple of things. That these entities… are real. They’re there. This is not fake. This is not a fraud.”</p><p>Roder claims that the video shows a “head… with smoke around it,” using what he believes is “some sort of cloaking device,” in the top right corner of the video peering over the fence.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-491752 alt="Shadowy Alien Footage" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shadowy-alien-footage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-491752 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube/Jim Quirk/Extraterrestrial Reality</span><span class=caption-body>Scott Roder believes the shadowy figure on the right of the photo is an alien with a “cloaking device.”</span></p><p>Ben Hansen, the host of the show UFO Witness, posited that this “head” could just be the shadow of the flashlight, but Roder disagrees.</p><p>“I don’t understand how the shadow could just be floating above the fence. I don’t believe that makes any sense,” he stated.</p><p>“You can’t manifest something to move inside the screen,” Roder said on an episode of Quirk’s <a href=# rel=noopener>podcast</a>. “I think that’s why I like this video is because you can clearly show something in the background that at least Angel and the uncle or his dad are reacting to.”</p><p>“It’s there,” Roder said. “It’s absolutely there.”</p><p>After reading about the backyard aliens in Las Vegas, dive into the story of the <a href=#>Varginha incident</a>, when multiple people in Brazil reported seeing aliens in 1996. Then, read about the story of the real <a href=#>Men in Black</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonytrdJmrZ6fkah6orjInqWs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./el-castillo-chichen-itza.html><span>←</span><span>El Castillo Then And Now Photos Reveal Its Stunning Rebirth In Chichen Itza</span></a>
