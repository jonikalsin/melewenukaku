I think everyone on the board was taking him at his word.”</p><p>In late 2016, Christopher countersued and claimed that the lawsuit cost his company ”millions of dollars in possible investments.” Furthermore, he accused America’s Test Kitchen of using the lawsuit as a ”nationwide media campaign” that defamed him.</p><p>Kimball was also sued by Milk Street Cafe, a restaurant owned by Marc Epstein, for trademark infringement. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in Kimball’s favor.</p><p>In August 2019, it was reported that Kimball and ATK had settled their lawsuit.
