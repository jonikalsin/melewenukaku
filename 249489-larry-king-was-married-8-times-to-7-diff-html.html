According to reports, Kaye gave birth to their son after they already parted ways.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALENE AKINS: 1961-1963</strong></p><p class=dh>Not a man to waste time brooding, King went on to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/larry-kings-7-ex-wives-divorce>tie the knot</a> with the third of his seven wives, former Playboy Bunny, Alene Akins; they would get married again later in the future.

Theirs was a marriage filled with ups and downs, including many infidelity rumors on both sides plaguing their marriage.</p><p class=dh>In all, the talk show legend was a grandfather to nine grandkids and a great-grandfather to four great-grandchildren due to his many marriages. Larry King would be greatly missed, a man with many great admirable qualities and a heart easy to love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrcmxobnqtrdGrsGajmaO0bsPArGSmmaKntqawjHFkraGdmsBuwM5mbmacmZuzb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexander-volkanovski-2.html><span>←</span><span>Alexander Volkanovski Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
