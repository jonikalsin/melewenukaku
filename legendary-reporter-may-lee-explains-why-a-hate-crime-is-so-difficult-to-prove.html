How do I know that his intent was motivated by hate or racial animus?”</b><span> Wu explains. </span><b>“So that’s one stumbling block for the prosecutors from a practical standpoint.”</b></p><p><span>Wu tells Lee that aside from analyzing available records — such as criminal history and social media posts — one way to clarify intent is to examine whether the defendant could have had other targets at the time of the crime.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><b>“How many other people did that defendant pass that morning? There are other surveillance cameras,”</b><span> Wu says. </span><b>“They did not just transport and arrive in front of the victim. They did not select other victims.”</b></p><p><span>Prosecutors may also argue that the general attitude in the country has been affected by associating COVID-19 with Asian people. This, according to Wu, is another way of pursuing a hate crime charge more creatively.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.statically.io/img/nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SHAN_WU-e1615583548900.jpg><p><span>Still, risk-averse prosecutors may decline to pursue hate crimes over fears of losing a conviction. </span><b>“They’re afraid to add anything which might give them one more piece of the puzzle that they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,”</b><span> Wu says.</span></p><p>Lee and Wu also discuss measures to prevent further hate crimes, such as possible legislative changes and community involvement.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p><strong>“Not everyone has to go on a protest. But reporting it, talking to law enforcement, not being shy about it … it will slowly, hopefully, start to change police and prosecutors’ viewpoint and make them somewhat more aggressive,”</strong> Wu says.</p><p>Watch the full interview:</p><p><span data-mce-type=bookmark class=mce_SELRES_start></span><i data-stringify-type=italic>Do you have a hate incident to report?
