He continued to play at the college level for the Arizona State Sun Devils, where he earned first-team All-American honors and was named the Pac-10 Defensive Freshman of the Year in 2009.

He led the Bengals in tackles during his rookie season and earned Pro Bowl honors in 2013 [6].

His on-field conduct led to him being suspended for a total of 22 games due to 14 separate incidents, accumulating over $5.3 million in fines and forfeited salary.

However, his history of controversial actions and suspensions raised doubts about his future in the league.
