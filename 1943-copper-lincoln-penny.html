Alternatively then, pennies were made of zinc-coated steel. Some copper pennies did make it into circulation accidentally and many scrambled to find one, dubbing the specialty “the Holy Grail of mint errors.”</p><p>It was rumored that even car mogul Henry Ford would trade a new automobile for the coin should anyone come across it. Allegedly, though, that myth was <a href=# rel=noopener>proven false</a>.</p><p>But, according to the Heritage Auction site, “the Mint steadfastly denied any copper specimens had been struck in 1943,” but the rumors were eventually proven true after copper planchets were found lodged in the bins used to feed blank coins in the presses at the end of 1942.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-202491 alt="Penny In Case" width=429 height=574 data-sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/penny-in-case-e1547141985997.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-202491 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Heritage Auctions</span><span class=caption-body>Don Lutes was initially told by the U.S. treasury that his find was a fake.</span></p><p>Lutes received offers for the coin for years until he approached the U.S. Treasury about it himself. He was assured that “all pennies struck in 1943 were zinc coated steel” and told that what he thought he had was, in fact, a fake. Lutes kept the coin anyway.</p><p>A similar penny sold for $1.7 million in 2010, and the current bid with Heritage Auctions hovers at $130,000.</p><p>Next, read about this doorstop that turned out to be <a href=#>a meteorite worth $100,000</a>.
