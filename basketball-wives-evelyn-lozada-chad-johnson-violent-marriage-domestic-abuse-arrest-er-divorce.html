They were in love, young and starry-eyed, ready to start their happily ever after — a story that was cut short by the NFL player's alleged headbutting. The couple was married for two months in 2012 and had a year of dating behind them.</p><p>Naturally, VH1 wanted to capture the newly-wed moments, which they did but unfortunately for showrunners, it had to be canceled after Chad's arrest on suspected domestic abuse charges. The show would be named 'Eve & Ocho'.&nbsp;</p><p>According to an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NFL report</a>, they got into an argument when Evelyn found a condom bill in their car. Soon, the verbal fight spiraled out of control and Evelyn found herself with a laceration that was caused by Chad's headbutt. After the player was taken into custody at Broward County Jail, he was cut off from the Miami Dolphins. The couple divorced later that year.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Basketball Wives' Season 9: Release date, trailer, cast, plot and all you need to know about VH1's reality show</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Basketball Wives': Rumor about Evelyn sleeping with Shaunie's ex and why Jennifer Williams may not return</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6fe81d52-cc04-4485-bea8-184e4323e4b9.108853538><p>Since then, Evelyn has moved on and Chad seems to have been very aware of the consequences of what that incident did to him and his flourishing career. In an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Showtime's 'Inside the NFL'</a>, he had confirmed that he has been taking anger management classes that have been helping him understand how to channel the rage.</p><p>There was a sense of regret when he said that he realized when the person who completed him wasn't around anymore. "But I just hadn't made that transition to where I needed to be the best man that I could or best husband that I could. I didn't make it all the way, fully."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b98f18d5-ef36-4ac6-8ec5-8ba2ed950705.97989486><p>It has been almost a decade since the couple's bitter divorce but it keeps coming up. Obviously, because a past like this will always come back to haunt. In July of 2020, Chad tweeted how he lost his temper for "3 seconds" and that cost him a lot. While most sympathized with him, Evelyn was plain upset to see him make such statements on public platforms.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I lost my temper for once in life for 3 seconds & it cost me a lifetimes worth of work, I got it all back plus some after getting a 2nd chance & NOTHING will ever get me out of that happy space again... <a href=#>https://t.co/svU3F0FeYP</a></p>— Chad Johnson (@ochocinco) <a href=#>July 16, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p><br>"People read this on social media and are coming at me talking about 'oh you made this man lose his job' it's like if you're gonna speak the truth, I want you to speak the truth as to what the situation was," she told TMZ sports and hinted that there were other times when she was assaulted by Chad. "What happened to me that day and other days, I didn't deserve. I didn't deserve that," the reality TV star added.&nbsp;</p><p>Evelyn will be next seen in 'Basketball Wives' Season 9 when it premieres on Tuesday, February 9, on VH1 at 8/7c.
